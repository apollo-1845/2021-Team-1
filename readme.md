# Team B███████████ - 2021 Astro Pi: Mission Space Lab submission

## 💭 Our aims
* Determining the concentration of greenhouse gases using NDVI in different parts of the earth’s atmosphere, relative to other gases and to map the earth’s magnetic field to determine how its strength and shape changes according to topographical features.
* Predicting any future changes in greenhouse gas concentration in various countries around the world as well as in the global magnetic fields.
* Using these results to determine any potentially important factors in the global ecosystem, and to calculate how to mitigate any negative effects.

## ⌨️ Our code
* [main.py](main.py) - This is the code that ran on the ISS
* The other Python files are snippets which eventually got incorporated into main.py

## 💥 Our results
[Visit our post processing repository](https://github.com/apollo-1845/2021-Team-B-post-processing) for the photos we took using the NoIR camera on the ISS, the location data we collected alongside these images, and the code we used to turn the images into numbers so that we could calculate greenhouse gas concentrations.
